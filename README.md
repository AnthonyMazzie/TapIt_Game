# TapIt_Game
The TapItGame asks the user to tap a randomly chosen letter from the alphabet.

The game starts by waiting 3 seconds for the player's 'letter tap' response.

If the player taps the correct letter on the keyboard, their score increases by 1.

Additionally, after each successful letter tap by the player, the game wait response time gets shorter. For example, if the user taps the correct letter the game response time is reduced by 0.25 seconds (on easy difficulty).

A player can win by getting a score of 5.

A player can lose by tapping an incorrect key or running out of time.

There are 3 possible difficulties in the game, which represent the amount of time the user has to tap the randomly produced letter.

Note: both upper- and lower-case letters are correct.
